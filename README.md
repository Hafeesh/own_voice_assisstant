Hello there.....welcome😁


Creating our own voice assisstant like alexa and siri, without wasting our money....

TO RUN IN PYTHON IDLE:-

For that first of all we need to install some libraries in command prompt, they are

1. SpeechRecognition -- used for recognizing user voice/speech.    (command to install - pip install SpeechRecognition)
2. PyAudio                                                         (command used to install - pip install PyAudio)
3. pyttsx3 -- library used to get response from PC.                (command used to install - pip install pyttsx3)
